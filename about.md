I'm Maxime, a 22 year old front-end developer from France. I'm specialized in Angular 1.x and Angular 2 but also in Highcharts, a Javascript chart library. I'm a Freelancer since 2k15 with my group: [Arcadmedia](//arcadmedia.com). I love food (especially asian food üç£), playing rugby with friends (I play as second row since 2008), and contributing to [open source](//github.com/maximelafarie) projects.

You may ask : "Why are you writing in english while you're french?". That's simple: I love writing about dev, tech an off topic themes but the problem is everybody don't understand french. So if I want to reach a large part of people, I have to write in english but no worries french friends, I probably will write some articles in both languages.
